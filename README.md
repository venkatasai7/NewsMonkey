NewsMonkey is a robust and user-friendly news aggregation platform, showcasing my skills in React development, including component-based architecture, state management, API integration, routing, and responsive design. This project highlights my ability to build scalable and maintainable web applications, effectively handling asynchronous data fetching and enhancing user experience with modern React techniques


### Abstract for "NewsMonkey" Project

**NewsMonkey** is a dynamic news aggregation application built with React, delivering top headlines from various categories such as business, entertainment, general, health, science, sports, and technology. This project showcases several essential React features and best practices, highlighting my proficiency in modern web development.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Component-Based Architecture**:
  - Modular and reusable components (`News`, `NewsItem`, `Navbar`, `Spinner`).
  - Promotes separation of concerns.

- **Routing with React Router**:
  - Client-side routing using `react-router-dom`.
  - Multiple routes for smooth navigation between news categories without page reloads.

- **State Management**:
  - Manages state with Reactâ€™s built-in state and lifecycle methods.
  - Handles loading states, pagination, and dynamic data fetching.

- **API Integration**:
  - Fetches data from the News API, demonstrating asynchronous operations.
  - Secure API key management with environment variables.

- **Pagination and Infinite Scroll**:
  - Implements pagination for navigating through news articles.
  - Uses `react-infinite-scroll-component` for dynamic loading.

- **Conditional Rendering and User Feedback**:
  - Displays a loading spinner during data fetches.
  - Conditional rendering based on application state.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Mobile-friendly with a collapsible navbar.
  - Styled using Bootstrap for responsiveness.

- **Prop Types and Default Props**:
  - Uses `prop-types` for type-checking and default values, ensuring code robustness.

**Technologies and Tools**:
- **React**: Core library for building the UI.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design.
- **News API**: External API for fetching news.
- **PropTypes**: For type-checking props.
- **Environment Variables**: For secure API key management.

NewsMonkey exemplifies my ability to build scalable, maintainable web applications with modern React practices, emphasizing component reuse, state management, and user experience enhancements.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
